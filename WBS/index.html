    <h2>Formal definition</h2>
    <p>WBS stands for Work breakdown structure.</p>

    <h2>What is really the WBS?</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          The WBS is a structure used to break down or divide the project work
          to define and better manage and communicate the project scope.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The WBS is an abstraction of the project scope.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          <s>The WBS is not what we have to do!</s> (tasks, processes). Instead
          <strong>is what we have to deliver</strong>. Is the answer to the
          question:
          <strong
            >What must be delivered to accomplish the project successully?. </strong
          >It presents the end vision, not the means to accomplish it.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
